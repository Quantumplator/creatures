#Welcome, Creatures

This is a customized headstart for developing client projects, built up from [underscores](http://underscores.me/), and flavored just the way I like it:

1. Tons of curry powder, little bit of salt and pepper.
2. [Maker's Mark](https://twitter.com/MakersMark) neat in my favorite tumbler.
3. Gojira playing in the background.
4. Run a search/replace for 'creatures' and your new theme name/slug.
5. Set the currentProj variable in gulpfile.js (if you still haven't gone [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/))
6. sudo npm install
7. wait for it
8. gulp bower && gulp fawesome
9. Profit.


## Consider implementing...

1. gulp-combine-media-queries (needs testing)
